      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        My mama’s famous lasagna recipe is hands down the best lasagna I have
        ever had in my life. She learnt this interpretation from her Italian
        friends while living in New York City. She has adjusted the recipe
        throughout the years to perfect it, and every single person that tries
        her recipe comes back for seconds, thirds and leftovers!

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>1 onion finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic cloves minced</li>
        <li>24 ounces ground beef mince (700 grams)</li>
        <li>10 ounces ground pork mince (300 grams) or beef</li>

      <h3>Steps</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat, then add in the onion and
          carrots and cook for 8-10 minutes, or until softened. Add in the
          garlic and sauté for about 1 minute, until fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add beef and pork (if using) and cook while breaking it up with the
          end of your spoon, until browned.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour in the Passata, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, crushed bouillon
          and dried herbs. Mix well to combine and bring to a gentle simmer.
          Season with desired amount of salt and pepper (I use about ¾ teaspoon
          each) and sugar if needed. Cover and cook for about 20-30 minutes,
          occasionally mixing, until the sauce has thickened slightly and meat
          is tender.
        </li>
        <li>Adjust salt, pepper and dried herbs to your taste.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, melt butter over medium heat. Remove from hot plate; add the flour and whisk for about 30 seconds, or until well blended.</li>
        <li>Place pot back onto stove, reduce heat down to low and slowly whisk in 1 cup of the milk until well combined. Once well blended, add the remaining milk in 1 cup increments, mixing well after each addition, until all the milk is used and sauce is free from lumps. If the sauce is too thick, add a little more milk until it turns into a nice and creamy consistency.
